# Majrix
A Clojure implementation of the Matrix client-server API

## What is Matrix?
Since they do it so well, we'll let [these guys](https://www.ruma.io/docs/matrix/) tell you. Go ahead, we'll wait.

The official [Matrix site](https://www.matrix.org) is also a great source of information.

## Um, I think you spelled closure wrong
No, no we didn't. In case you're not already aware of it's awesomeness, [Clojure](https://www.clojure.org), is a functional programming language that runs on the JVM.

[Clojure For the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com) is an excellent resource.
